## Install

Drop it somewhere in your pythonpath (e.g. the current directory). That's it!

## Usage

Just use it! `import gay` is enough.
Alternatively, see `test_magic.py` for how to rainbowify only selected texts, instead of the entire output.

## TODOs

* Maybe make it work with bpython and other interpreters that override stdout in some form?
